# CORBA-RMIIIOP
This repository contains a project regarding middleware technologies such as CORBA Java IDL and RMIIIOP

Since the support for CORBA and RMIIIOP is no longer maintained for the newest JDK versions, I used a JDK for Java 8 only.
The build tool used for the project is gradle version 7.3.3.

To build the project you need to set some environment variables such as JAVA_HOME, GRADLE_HOME and add them into PATH.
To easy deploy and run, there is a script called run.bat which requires a parameter which is about the technology we want to use.
